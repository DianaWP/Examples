                <h1>First Projects</h1>
                <p>My very first projects when I started learning to code are always going to be special to me. They were pretty basic and probably not done terribly well but they worked and they are the spark that kept me going. The very first project was
                    through my work at the time. The National Archives had seen all these vintage radios popping up and knew that people were able to connect them to the internet somehow but they weren’t really sure how to go about getting something like
                    this done so they came to the AV company where I was working as the Office Coordinator. We mostly installed digital signage and AV systems into schools and government buildings so the original solution was to connect up a device that
                    would play set pieces of the audio which the vintage radio would sit on top of. This would have looked like most museum exhibits where you of course press the big metal button on the outside of the display but the hope was that the
                    radio could take part in a travelling exhibition related to early immigration within Australia.The audio in question had originally played on radio stations and included segments to teach basic conversational English to immigrants.<br>                    At this point I asked my boss if I could show him a proof of concept using a raspberry pi and some Pyhton that I had been learning and he agreed. I did get some help from a friend who looked after the electronic side of things and
                    together we went to work. The radio was completely dead so we removed most of the internal workings and replaced them with a small powered speaker and the raspberry pi. I also used jewellery string to fix the dial as I knew you could
                    get specific weights of thread and we fixed the radio so the dials turned to set the station and we hooked up the volume switch to the raspberry pi breadboard. This meant we could program the on/off switch and control the volume. My
                    colleague also set up a little strip of warm LED lights so the station selector would light up as if the radio was working as expected.<br> At this point I was ready to write the program to play the selected audio files. I started
                    out with a simple tutorial from the Adafruit site which got me a lot of the way but I decided to use the readout from the oscilloscope so we could set specific marked stations to play one file rather than having them play one after
                    the other so you would “dial in” the station and it would start playing a set piece from the audio file.<br> This was a great first project because whilst the programming aspect was fairly simple I had to solve a lot of specific problems
                    that were unique to the customers requirements and the radio body we were using. Unfortunately as I did this for a previous employer I no longer have access to the final code but I am very proud to know that the National Archives has
                    a display that I worked on.

                <h1>It Better Not Be Too Late</h1>
                <p>It is never too late. One question I see and hear a lot is “Am I too old to learn to program” and to that I have to say…. I bloody hope not. I just turned 39 and I am not quite where I want to be just yet, but I am still enjoying the journey.
                    I wont lie and say its not hard and I have certainly loaded up Seek and looked for another office job on occasion, but I can’t. I have discovered programming and the women that do it and I can’t go back now, I’m having too much fun.<br>                    I have made some amazing friends through this journey, some if whom I have never even met. The women in tech community have been nothing short of amazing and encouraging every step of the way. I get that it can be overwhelming, especially
                    if, like me, you ever worry about making the wrong decision because let’s face it there is so much to learn. So much you could learn! So much you could do with this newfound skill I mean how is anyone supposed to know where to start
                    and then where to go? And its true, the possibilities are basically endless but to me that’s also what kind of makes it fun.<br> I was very good in school up to a point but I’ll be honest once I got out of primary school and I was
                    supposed to pick courses that would decide my future I became very disillusioned by being told what to learn. Suddenly my assignments were no longer “pick a native animal and tell us whatever you want about it” but more “Answer this
                    specific question based on what we specifically read in this textbook”.<br>One of the things I love so far about programming is that you may have a style guide to follow but basically there will be a bunch of ways to get the same result
                    and if you get that result then it’s probably ok and as you learn you will discover other ways that also work but are maybe even better. Another thing that made me fall in love with programming and the tech community is that I can
                    combine it with anything I want. My imagination is the only thing stopping me (which, to be fair is a big roadblock but maybe you have a better imagination than I do).<br> I also really enjoy how creative it is. I have never been very
                    good at craft and I cant draw to save my life but I always tried different hobbies because I find creative pursuits scratch a very specific itch. The trouble was I never had the time, money or talent to really get where I needed and
                    I would always get frustrated with how much effort I needed to put in to catch up to other people I admired. You know the people that seem to be inherently better at a thing? I know they are the first to tell you that they also find
                    it hard but for some reason programming scratches that same itch and whilst I know I am behind and there is certainly people I admire who will always be better than me, for some reason it matters less.<br> Maybe its because if I can
                    get my program to do what I want then it is good enough even if someone does it prettier and faster than me or maybe its just because I love it more than I did other crafts. Its still frustrating and I still have major imposter syndrome
                    but for some reason I just cant quit it.

                    <h1>Vogue Codes 2020</h1>
                    <p>So its Vogue Codes time of the year, slightly later and way more virtual than normal but hey that’s 2020 for you.<br> Today saw Vogue Codes Live kick off with a focus on beauty and wellness and its intersection with Tech. We also got
                        to see the lovely Derek Blasberg talk about how the fashion industry has been able to use video and virtual technology this year to keep fashion shows going which was interesting. As horrendous as this year has been I think it
                        has only cemented the idea that we need to utilise technology to solve problems not just in health and well being but in the things that bring us joy like fashion. <br>We have lost plenty of brands which is never a good thing but
                        at the same time smaller brands have been able to come to the forefront in a way they couldn’t before just by being able to pivot quickly and to place themselves in front of an audience thirsty for, and ready for new types of content.
                        The same can be said about the workplace in general, we can no longer go on doing things the way they have always been done and nor should we.<br> This is also the perfect time to take that leap and put yourself in front of a company
                        you want to work for whether they are advertising or not. I know I am very excited by the prospect of being able to apply to dream companies that are now more willing to take on remote workers. Tech is the great democratiser but
                        only if we have diverse talent working on the solutions. We are still in the early stages where most anyone can join and make changes but we do need it to happen soon, we cannot let tech lock people out just like every other industry
                        that came before.<br> The statistics have been getting ever so slightly better since Vogue Codes has been happening but its not enough yet. The world of tech is so vast and it really can encompass so many industries but at the
                        same time if we don’t have diverse voices asking the right questions then we run the risk of industries being left behind. If we can get more diverse voices in the right places, we can make a big difference to what tech looks like
                        in the future.<br> Think about the women who have a great idea for an app but do not have the ability or time to learn to code to bring it to life. If the only people she can seek financial support from or tech know how do not
                        have the same outlook then she may have a much harder time getting the app into your hands. The more people we have at all levels, the more problems we are going to be able to solve that affect more people. I will admit I have
                        had a pretty rough month with imposter syndrome but for some reason I just cant quit. <br>I find programming to be so creative and fun (when it is not making me feel like a complete idiot). Its hard going but it is worth it in
                        the end. I have tried a few different areas of tech and I am confident that I want to be a programmer with a side of writing articles about it. I am not sure I will ever be confident enough to give a technical talk but I do enjoy
                        encouraging people to change careers and join the tech industry so writing articles and doing talks on that subject I find quite fun. I am not sure anyone is interested in reading said articles or hearing my voice on the topic
                        but I am passionate about it nonetheless.

                        <h1>For The Love of Social Media</h1>
                        <p>I know social media is getting a bad rep and honestly I get it. I certainly am very glad it was not a thing when I was in high school but in saying that I am also old enough to remember the days before the internet. Heck I had
                            internet before you could use it in school assignments so I was still handwriting reports using old library books when I knew there was a whole world of info out there.<br> So, whilst I am glad social media has no truly horrendous
                            images of me I also wouldn’t ever go back to the before times because through the internet and specifically social media I have met the most loving, supportive and sharing community surrounding women in tech.<br> Most of these
                            women I have never met and plenty of them I may never get to meet but whenever I am stuck on a problem or feeling like I cannot do this they are right there to tell me that not only can I do this but I damn well should be doing
                            this. Its like having a team of cheerleaders who know exactly what you are going through and are doing everything in their power to support you.<br> I have tried plenty of hobbies over the years and at one stage or another
                            had considered trying to turn some into a side hustle but none of those circles were even remotely as supportive or accepting of beginners. So many places have the mentality of “I had to earn my dues so you do too” and while
                            you probably will still find that in tech, especially in the workplace, I have found the community around women in tech to be so supportive and proud of beginners.<br> Whether you are a young girl doing a summer course or like
                            me trying to start a new career these ladies will have your back every step of the way. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you work the community on Instagram and Twitter will welcome you and cheer you on and on those days
                            when you cant find that missing semi colon anywhere it is a breath of fresh air and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.<br> Even if I never get my dream job and never meet most of these women and men in real life I genuinely
                            care about them and I will always follow their journey so I can cheer them on as well.

                            <h1>General Assembly</h1>
                            <p>This week marked the start of 10 weeks studying Javascript with General Assembly. I have been self teaching for so long and I am constantly getting distracted by ideas or trying to build something and getting so stuck that
                                I drop it so this is kind of my last ditch attempt to study something start to finish and end up with a simple but actual functioning project at the end of it.<br> So far its been exactly what I hoped for with a small but
                                collaborative class and a teacher who knows his stuff. The General Assembly teachers are working professionals and everyone in my cohort either works in tech and wants to solidify skills or works adjacent to tech and wants
                                to know more. The mix is almost also 50% women which is nice, not sure if they try to make that a thing or not I am going to have to work hard to do well, its going to be a pretty intense course and having to log back in
                                to work as soon as I finish can be a little distracting but hopefully as long as I work hard and practice then it will hopefully stick. I want to finish the assignment and then immediately redo it again and again so I better
                                come up with a few assignment options. We will start getting homework from next week too so that will be fun. I will need to be disciplined and again I think its best if I go over the homework a few times just to really
                                allow it to sink in.<br>
                                <br> So I guess a little update is needed. I absolutely loved doing the General Assembly course. I have hit a bit of a low point since so I definitely didn’t do as much study after the fact but I enjoyed the course and
                                I enjoyed the final assignment. I am still working towards joining the dev team full time at work but that seems to be tracking and I am still doing plenty of study. I just need to lock down a project to build myself without
                                necessarily following a tutorial for the whole thing but I have some ideas in mind and I have gotten better at practising over and over again. I am hoping to shift focus to C# and .Net which is proving to be a lot of fun.
                                I did really enjoy the General Assembly course and if they had a C# course and I had cash I would sign up in a heartbeat.

                            <p>So I am writing this partly to procrastinate finishing packing but also because I am so excited! Vogue Codes is back this week and its live! I am one covid vaccine down and I am ready to network my little heart out and to be
                                so inspired I will burst.<br> After the last live Vogue Codes where I decided it would be totally practical to drive up from Canberra the morning of I am now busing up the day before so hopefully I will look a lot less
                                flustered when arriving at Carriageworks.<br> I still have one day left to pack everything and make sure I have everything I need (as a Canberran I admit I did have to go hunting for my mask for the bus) and of course I
                                am putting the final touches on this website.<br> I just need to not touch it for a couple of weeks before deciding to redo the whole thing just in case anyone wants to hire me. I will of course be bringing my laptop to
                                Sydney so I can write up my thoughts after the event and I will hopefully remember to post many photos to Instagram throughout the day. I always love Vogue Codes but I am particularly excited by the amount of women programmers
                                on the line up this year.<br> I really enjoy the entrepreneur aspect of the talks and it certainly is inspiring but I am definitely keen to meet more programmers and to also meet up with my favourite entrepreneurs to talk
                                about how I can help their business. <br>I know so many people dream of being their own boss and so many people have amazing ideas for products and services but for me I am definitely more interested in helping people bring
                                their vision to life as a programmer on their team. Nonetheless there is still this amazing buzz I get from being in a massive room full of women interested in or at the very least intrigued by working in tech in some form.
                                I love this industry and I love fashion so seeing them come together to inspire more women to join just fills my heart to the brim.<br> I cannot wait to see you all there.

                    <h1>Dynalite to Smart Lights</h1>
                    <h4>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>My second ever project when I was just starting out was a fairly simple sounding request. My colleague at work used to install semi smart lights called Dynalite. These were the go to smart light before we figured out you could connect
                        lights to the internet but they were still considered smart because you had a fancy touch panel to control them.<br> You mostly only saw them in office buildings and the like but as an installer my friend had set up his whole house
                        with them as well.<br> The trouble with the lights was that you had to be a licensed installer to be able to use the software that was needed to set the lights up and there was no way to control the lights without using the touch
                        panels. Through talking to the manufacturer we did discover however that there had been some investigation on using the internet but at that stage it had been put on the backburner. It did however mean there was a tiny section
                        in the installers guide with some addresses you could connect to. This was not a lot to go off but we decided it was worth a try. <br> With a little help from a much more experienced software engineer we discovered the addresses
                        were not quite right and were able to find the correct ones and we were off.<br> I don’t know that I would recommend this as a beginner project as there definitely wasn’t a single tutorial to assist but through a lot of trial and
                        error we figured out that the IP address on my friends home network needed to be static so once that was set up we simply set about using JavaScript to control turning the lights on and off per section as well as setting options
                        to set to 50% and 75% in some rooms using simple OnClick events and Buttons. <br>With a little HTML and CSS we set up a simple web page with the labelled buttons and from there my friend was able to control his lights simply by
                        using his mobile phone from wherever he was without needing to buy all new lights and panels.

                    <p>Of course like everyone else starting to program I have also made my share of Calculators and TIC TAC TOE games. These are of course great starter example with any language though I have only done these with C++ and JavaScript myself.<br>                        There is 100’s of tutorials you can follow and most text books have an example within the first few chapters so they are a really great way to cut your teeth on a new language if you want to do more than print “Hello World” to
                        the screen.<br> I started out using C++ which definitely leaves a bit to be desired in the looks department so I did enjoy remaking them both using JavaScript and HTML CSS as not only could I get the basic functionality the same
                        I could also make them look a lot nicer. It is also a great way to see the differences in the languages and although I was using JavaScript in an Object Oriented way there was still enough differences to make it interesting

                    <h4>HTML CSS JavaScript React</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have built plenty of mini websites as I have studied. <br>Firstly through Open University Australia where I had to build a website using only HTML and CSS but still using images and multi pages. I also decided to try out AWS
                        and stored the site in an S3 bucket as I was interested in learning how that all worked. The website of course was fairly basic and I went with a simple design for an imaginary fashion stylist. I had a lot of fun building that
                        site and still have the domain name though I turned off the S3 instance to avoid the possible AWS costs. I have also built fake portfolio sites whilst doing the front end course through Treehouse which was a lot of fun and introduced
                        me to React. The Treehouse courses do provide a coding environment and plenty of assistance as well. <br>Finally of course we have the website you are reading this on. This one is pretty basic and just built from scratch using
                        HTML and CSS as I don’t really need to add JavaScript at this stage. I will of course continue to update it and try new things but for now I just wanted a very simple site. I am using a custom domain from Hover and hosting with
                        Netlify

                    <h1>General Assembly Projects</h1>
                    <h4>HTML CSS JavaScript React
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Studying with General Assembly was a great experience. I did the 10 week part time JavaScript course and I would love to go back for more.<br> I really enjoyed having a teacher that was very knowledgeable and being able to speak
                        to other people in my cohort live was wonderful. Everyone we very helpful and had different levels of knowledge so you could always get help if you ever got stuck. Each week we basically worked on a new project and quite a bit
                        of time was spent working with connecting to API’s which I found really informative.<br> The types of projects we worked on included a chat bot with pre selected messages. A Movie Search using the IMDB API as well as a music search
                        using the Spotify API and a Wine app using firebase and API connectors all of which were really interesting and well thought out. <br> Generally we would start the class with a little starter code and follow along to a tutorial
                        and then for the second day and that weeks homework we would need to add additional features to the project built in class. You could definitely tell which class members had more of a design background as some of the homework results
                        looked amazing but there was never any judgement of those with less artistic talents (aka me).
                        <br> The final project for the course required us to connect to an API of our choosing and needed to produce output based on user input. We all had to come up with a plan and discuss it with our teacher who would give us feedback
                        and suggestions as well as approval to go ahead with our idea.<br> My chosen idea was JacketApp which was designed to connect to a weather API that would give you the expected daily temperature from any city you desired. Based
                        on the given temperature the app would then show a jacket that would suit the weather. So if it was rainy and cold you would be shown the image of a parka, if it was cold but dry you would get a faux fur etc through to mid weight
                        jackets and light cardigans until you reached a temp that was warm enough to not need a jacket. I used RapidAPI to connect to the OpenWeather API. This allowed me to get the temp from any city in the world, convert to Celsius and
                        then based on ranges that I set would select an image to show on the website.<br> I plan to go back to this app and update it with more jacket options and possibly will add a section for shoes and I also wish to rewrite it in .Net.
                        I was of course inspired to work on this app due to my love of jackets and the “All you need is a light Jacket” line from Miss Congeniality. One day I will work out how to build the closet app from Clueless but for now I will start
                        there.

                        Recently I found myself stuck in a bit of a learning rut. I was working on a few ideas that were a bit bigger and as such I had neglected a few of my “I definitely want to go back and refactor this” projects but I just wasn’t motivated by looking at my
                        old code that I had already got working.<br> So whilst procrastinating on Instagram I came across a wonderful set of tutorials by the wonderful DanaScript. She has built The Ultimate API Challenge and set
                        up a wonderful website where you can get your hands dirty completing the challenges https://theultimateapichallenge.com/challenges. <br>They have a few different options and you can either load up the starter code from Github and
                        follow along with the provided YouTube videos or you can dive straight in with a few hints and some links to documentation that could come in handy.<br> These are great for going over connecting to API’s and getting the required
                        data as well as practicing setting up basic web apps over and over. You can use as little or as much guidance as you like and I have found that I enjoy starting off with the tutorial but skipping ahead from time to time and of
                        course making changes to the CSS to make it more my own. <br>Something about the way they are set out has really helped remind me that I have learned a lot and I can actually build things and troubleshoot as I go. I think they
                        are great for beginners who want to move from the slow and steady hand holding tutorials from say CodeCademy to a slightly more intermediate option but still want to have that person right there to help if you get stuck.<br> I
                        am currently up to the Lyrics API challenge and I look forward to completing them all.

                    <h1>C# Work</h1>
                    <h4>C# .Net</h4>
                    <p>Currently through my role I work mostly with Microsoft Dynamics and whilst most of the programming I have done has been on the JavaScript side I am very keen to learn more about C# and .Net moving forward.<br> I have done the usual
                        tutorials and recently completed one which required building the game Breakout (basically pong against a wall of bricks instead of an opponent). I have ordered a few text books as well as I really enjoy reading up on new languages
                        as much as I enjoy working with them.<br> My next plan is to work on an app that I have had in my head for years. In a previous life I worked for a high end jewellery store and part of my role was to write up valuations and photograph
                        jewellery for the purpose of being insured and on the other side I also had to type up the insurance claims when people had lost their jewellery.<br> When your jewellery is lost or stolen the general process is you go through the
                        store to try and find similar items to what was stolen and those details are provided to the insurance company to then decide how much to give the client. Now obviously this is a lot quicker and easier if you have photos of the
                        item and any specific details and whilst all insurance companies and policies are different I promise they are a lot faster with writing that cheque if we can include photos and specific details. My idea from there is to create
                        a small app where you can photograph your piece and simply select the details such as stone type and size, weight, type of metal etc when it is fresh in your mind so if the worst was to happen, you have it right there with you
                        ready to send off.<br> Basically after working in a jewellery store I have pieces I would want replaced but even knowing what I know, I do not have every piece recorded so the app is also a great way to motivate me to photograph
                        all my pieces and write down what I have. The best reason to build something.
